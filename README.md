# Remezova
I ([@fruitourist](https://github.com/fruitourist)) tried to train the Fully Convolutional Network *ResNet101* on *Gaofen Image Dataset* to gem one of the 15 classes â€” *Irrigated Land*. I was able to achieve a median Pixel Accuracy of *0.703* and a median IoU of *0.523*. You can also read an article (tutorial) on this project on [Habr](https://habr.com/ru/post/721414/).
